## Sample exploration

Data exploration examples using `pandas`.

#### How to read the data into a `Pandas.DataFrame`?

```python
In [1]: import pandas as pd

In [2]: df = pd.read_csv('2015-16/data.csv')
```

#### How many shots have Leicester taken when playing in home this season?

```python
In [4]: sum(df[df.home_team == 'Leicester'].total_shots_home_team)
Out[4]: 204
```

#### How many goals have Man Utd scored so far this season?

```python
In [5]: sum(df[df.home_team == 'Man Utd'].home_goals) + sum(df[df.away_team == 'Man Utd'].away_goals)
Out[5]: 49
```


... and the possibilities are endless! :smile:
